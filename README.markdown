# Copy As Markdown
##  Chrome Extension

Pretty simple usage and description:  
Select some text (preferrably a block of text, like an entire blog article), right click, click on "Copy As Markdown"  

Now the Markdown version of your selected text *should* be in your clipboard. Paste them anywhere you wish!

There are some bugs in the HTML to Markdown converter. I am working on these.
